# twitter-bot

hey my name is snowy and this is my twitter bot.

firstly you will need to install python on your device and set it up and add python to your system variables. I would reccomend you following a youtube tutorial for this. Next you want to install vscode and also set it up but this is pretty self explanitory. You then want to download the pluging inside visual studio called python and pylance and set those up next you wanna type this into cmd  once you launched it as admin:  pip --v 

if a number pops up  such as 365.06 or etc ur ready to go

now you want to again launch cmd as admin and write: pip install tweepy
once that is completed you wanna also write pip install time
these are api's you will need to run the script
then you can create a txt file on your desktop and make sure your file extenstions are visable such as .txt then rename it to tentoy.py
open that file in vscode. then copy and paste my script into it. 

you will also need to download code runner in vscode. i reccomed watching a tutorial for downloading plugins if your not familier with it.
next copy and paste my code into the text editor. Now ctrl f and look for # because where ever there is a # you will need to fill in your twiiter account access key and token.
do get your twitter access key and token you will need to go to developer.twiiter.com and apply for it. for me it took like 30 minutes to get approved. Now watch a youtube tutorial and look how to create a project and get api key and get our access token and etc.

now fill your access token and your api access token in the respected/ designated area and now run the code.
